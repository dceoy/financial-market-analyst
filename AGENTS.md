# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository combines a Python package, automation scripts, and a Hugo static site. Reusable implementation logic lives in `src/aims/` (the `aims` package). Agent skill scripts under `.agents/skills/`, especially `market-analysis/scripts/` and `update-cfd-instruments/scripts/`, are thin CLI wrappers that delegate to `src/aims/`. Tests and fixtures are in `tests/`, with golden report output in `tests/golden/`. Data files and JSON schemas are in `data/` and `data/schema/`. Hugo content, archetypes, and configuration live in `content/`, `archetypes/`, and `config/_default/`; the generated site is written to the ignored `site/` directory.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `uv sync --group dev`: install Python development tools from `uv.lock`.
- `uv run pytest`: run the Python test suite with branch coverage.
- `uv run ruff format .`: format Python files.
- `uv run ruff check --fix .`: lint and apply safe Ruff fixes.
- `uv run pyright .`: run strict type checks for `src/aims/`, agent skill scripts, and `tools/`.
- `hugo --gc --minify`: build the static site (requires Go for Hugo Modules).
- `hugo server --buildDrafts`: preview the site locally, including draft posts.
- `.agents/skills/local-qa/scripts/qa.sh`: run the full local QA workflow used by contributors.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Python targets 3.13. Ruff enforces 88-character lines, Google-style docstrings, import sorting, and strict lint rules. Prefer typed functions and `pathlib` over string path manipulation. Apply KISS, DRY, and YAGNI: keep implementations simple, reuse existing helpers and patterns, and avoid abstractions or features before they are needed. Test files use `test_*.py`, and test names should describe behavior. Keep generated Hugo reports named like `YYYY-MM-DD-market-analysis.md` under `content/results/`.

## Testing Guidelines

Pytest is configured in `pyproject.toml` and requires 100% branch coverage for all modules under `src/aims/`. Add or update fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` and golden output in `tests/golden/` when changing report generation or parser behavior. Validate CFD data with:

```bash
uv run python .agents/skills/update-cfd-instruments/scripts/validate_cfd_instruments.py --input data/cfd_instruments.csv --schema data/schema/cfd_instruments.schema.json
```

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history uses concise Conventional Commit-style subjects such as `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, and scoped variants like `feat(data): ...`. Keep commits focused and include issue or PR references when relevant. Pull requests should explain the change, list validation commands run, link related issues, and include screenshots or generated report paths when the Hugo output changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit secrets or local environment files. Operational details, scheduled workflows, Slack notifications, and required repository secrets are documented in `OPERATIONS.md`. GitHub Actions live in `.github/workflows/`; run the full QA script after workflow edits because it applies `zizmor`, `actionlint`, `yamllint`, and `checkov`.

## OKF Knowledge Layer

OKF v0.2 primary references: [specification](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md) and [Google Cloud announcement](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing).

- Treat `okf/` as the canonical source for durable AIMS knowledge.
- Treat `content/knowledge/` as generated Hugo shadow content; do not hand-edit it.
- Treat OKF v0.2 `index.md` and `log.md` as reserved files, not concept documents; do not add concept front matter to those files.
- Use `generated: { by, at }` and front matter `sources`; do not use legacy `timestamp` or body-level `# Citations`.
- Use only `draft`, `stable`, or `deprecated` for concept lifecycle `status`.
- Keep `data/analysis/*.json` authoritative for numeric market facts, scores, ranks, dates, risk gates, and data availability.
- Keep `content/results/` as the public daily analysis report output.
- After OKF edits, regenerate and validate shadow content, then build Hugo:

  ```bash
  uv run python tools/okf_hugo_adapter.py --src okf --dst content/knowledge --clean
  uv run python tools/okf_hugo_adapter.py --src okf --dst content/knowledge --check
  hugo --gc --minify
  ```

- Do not hand-edit `content/knowledge/`; fix drift by regenerating from `okf/`.
- Do not introduce vector databases, embeddings pipelines, external RAG services, custom CMS layers, or server-side runtimes for the OKF layer.
