## AI Market Commentary

> **AI-generated section.** Produced by `claude-opus-4-8` (prompt v1.0.0) from the committed evidence bundle and quantitative artifact, after schema validation and deterministic consistency gates. It does not modify the scores, ranks, risk gates, or market regime above, and it is not investment advice — see the Disclaimer section below.

**Recurring themes:**

### Dow Jones Industrial Average / ^DJI — neutral (confidence: low)

- Coverage notes a modest monthly gain of 2.1 percent amid thin instrument-specific news. [3]

## Methodology

Instruments are scored and ranked cross-sectionally using the following features:

- **Momentum**: 1-day, 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day returns
- **Trend**: Distance from 20-day and 50-day moving averages
- **Volatility**: 20-day realized annualized volatility (lower is better)
- **Drawdown**: Maximum drawdown over 60 days (lower is better)
- **RSI**: 14-day Relative Strength Index
- **Z-score**: Price z-score relative to 20-day mean

Each feature is converted to a cross-sectional percentile rank. The composite score is the mean percentile across all features (0–100).
